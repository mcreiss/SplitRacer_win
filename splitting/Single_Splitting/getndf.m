function NDF = getndf(S, n, norig)

% A array is assumed to contain a possibly interpolated time series
% of length n.  The length of the original uninterpolated time series
% is NORIG.  ndf_spect computes the effective
% number of degrees of freedom in A, which for a gaussian white noise
% process should be equal to norig.  The true ndf should be less than
% NORIG

% calculate the Number of Degrees-Of-Freedom of a summed and squared time
% series with spectrum array A. A is assumed to be a complex function of
% frequency with A[0] corresponding to zero frequency and A[N-1]
% corresponding to the Nyquist frequency.  If A[t] is gaussian distributed
% then ndf_spect should be the points in the original time series 2*(N-1).

nf = round((n2+2)/2); % only take half of the spectrum, to Nyquist frequency
mag = abs(OUT(1:nf));

E2 = sum(mag.^2);
E4 = sum(mag.^4);

E2 = E2-.5*mag(1).^2-.5*mag(end).^2;
E4 = 4*E4/3-mag(1).^4-mag(end).^4; %*

% based on theory, the following expression should yield
% the correct number of degrees of freedom.(see appendix of silver
% and chan, 1990.  In practise, it gives a value that gives
% a df that is slightly too large.  eg 101 for an original time
% series of 100.  This is due to the fact that their is a slight
% positive bias to the estimate using only the linear term.
